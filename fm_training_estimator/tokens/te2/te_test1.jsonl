{"text": "Venus is notable for having the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover."}
{"text": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water."}
{"text": "The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname 'the Red Planet'. Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing."}
{"text": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. A gas giant, Jupiter's mass is more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion. "}
{"text": "Saturn is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth, prominently known for its rings."}
{"text": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles."}
{"text": "Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth."}
{"text": "Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune."}
